\title{Convert a vector of values into sequential numeric labels}
\usage{
relabel(x, start = 0L)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector (character, factor, numeric, logical) to relabel.}

\item{start}{Integer scalar giving the first value for the sequence (default 0).}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{new_values}: integer vector of sequential labels (start..start+k-1). NAs are preserved as \code{NA}.
\item \code{old_labels}: vector of the unique values from \code{x} in order of appearance (may include \code{NA}).
}
}
\description{
This function accepts a vector of character, factor, numeric, or logical
values and maps each unique non-NA value (in order of first appearance)
to a sequential integer starting at \code{start}. NAs in the input are preserved
as \code{NA} in the output. The function returns a list containing the new
integer vector and the vector of unique values (including \code{NA} if present)
in order of appearance; the latter is useful for plot labels.
